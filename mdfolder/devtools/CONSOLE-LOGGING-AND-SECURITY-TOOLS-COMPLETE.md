## **📊 Enhanced Console Output**

Your browser console now shows **color-coded, structured logs**:

```
🔵 INFO [2025-01-15T10:30:45.123Z] Dashboard accessed successfully
   └─ userId: abc123, userEmail: user@example.com

🟠 SECURITY [2025-01-15T10:31:00.012Z] Privacy setting changed
   └─ severity: medium, userId: abc123
   └─ details: { setting: "showEmail", oldValue: true, newValue: false }

⚡ PERF [2025-01-15T10:31:05.345Z] Slow operation detected: update_privacy_settings
   └─ duration: 1250ms, threshold: 1000ms

🔴 ERROR [2025-01-15T10:30:50.789Z] Privacy settings update failed
   └─ component: privacy_controls, userId: abc123
   └─ metadata: { setting: "profileVisibility", error: "Network timeout" }
```

## **🧪 Testing Checklist**

### **Console Logging**
- [ ] Privacy settings changes show security events
- [ ] Database operations show performance timing
- [ ] Errors display with full context
- [ ] Authentication events are tracked
- [ ] Log export downloads JSON file

### **Security Tools**
- [ ] Security scan runs and shows results
- [ ] XSS testing detects vulnerabilities
- [ ] Reports export automatically
- [ ] UI shows scan progress and results
- [ ] Console shows detailed security logs

### **Performance Monitoring**
- [ ] Slow operations trigger alerts
- [ ] Database queries are timed
- [ ] Performance stats are accurate
- [ ] Metrics export correctly

---

## **🔧 Browser Console Commands**

Use these commands directly in browser console:

```javascript
// Security scanning
await runSecurityScan()
testXSSInput('<script>alert("test")</script>')

// Monitoring
const stats = monitoring.getStats()
const logs = monitoring.exportLogs()
monitoring.clearLogs()

// Custom logging
logInfo('Test message', { test: true })
logSecurityEvent({
  type: 'suspicious_activity',
  severity: 'low',
  details: { action: 'manual_test' },
  timestamp: new Date().toISOString()
})
```

---

## **🚨 What to Monitor**

### **Performance Alerts**
Watch for operations taking >1000ms:
```
⚡ PERF [timestamp] Slow operation detected: operation_name
   └─ duration: 1250ms, threshold: 1000ms
```

### **Security Events**
Monitor privacy and authentication changes:
```
🟠 SECURITY [timestamp] Privacy setting changed
   └─ severity: medium, details: { setting: "showEmail" }
```

### **Error Patterns**
Track recurring errors for debugging:
```
🔴 ERROR [timestamp] Database operation failed
   └─ component: privacy_controls, error: "Connection timeout"
```

---

## **🎯 Production Considerations**

### **Environment Detection**
- Developer tools auto-show in development
- Hidden by default in production
- Manual toggle available for debugging

### **Performance Impact**
- Minimal overhead in production
- Local storage rotation prevents memory issues
- Structured logging improves debugging efficiency

### **Security**
- No sensitive data logged
- User IDs tracked for audit purposes
- Error messages sanitized for production

---

## **🚀 Next Steps**

1. **Test the Integration**: Run `yarn dev` and explore the tools
2. **Monitor Performance**: Watch for slow operation alerts
3. **Review Security**: Run regular security scans
4. **Export Data**: Download and analyze log files
5. **Customize**: Adjust thresholds and logging levels as needed
